% Analysis of the results:
% With an Es/No of 1/1000 (i.e. -30 dB) we have
% an actual BER of 0.4898 and a theoretical bit error proba of 0.4874
% an actual SER of 0.7396 and a theoretical symbol error proba of 0.7372
% In both cases, the empirical and theoretical figures are strikingly
% close. 
% The results seem good, however errors or inconsistencies 
% (or at least optimization are possible) are most likely since there 
% are many aspects that still elude me even after 
% a lot of reading and thinking...
